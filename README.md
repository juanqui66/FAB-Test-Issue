## FAB & AdMob Pro do not coexist properly

Example with which reproduces the situation described in the 'current behavoir'

It is based on an App menuSide to which a banner and an interstitial have been added. An FAB has also been added at the bottom of the home.html and list.html pages.

The banner and the interstitial have been added in the ngOnInit method of the home.ts and list.ts files, where an advertising service is called, which is available in FAB-Test-Issue \ src \ classes \ services \ advertising- Service.ts.

Advertising is initialized in the initializeAp() of app.component.ts, calling this.publicidad.inicializaAdmob().

### Current behavoir:

[Ionic issue](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/12746).

When using an FAB in the bottom, in a page where we have enabled in the foot an AdMob Pro banner and in that same page, when we enter it (in event ngOnInit) we load an interstitial of AdMob Pro, when closing the interstitial, the FAB is hidden under the banner.

This only happens in IOS. Android works properly and the FAB is above the banner.

In IOS, in addition to hiding the FAB, the bottom of the page is also covered by the banner. It is as if after showing the interstitial, the size of the page happens to occupy the entire screen space of the mobile, without realizing that at the bottom of it has been loaded a banner.

### Expected behavior:
The FAB should be above the banner, as in the first image.
